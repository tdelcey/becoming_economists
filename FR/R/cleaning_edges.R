#################### Cleaning the Data Linking Theses and Entities ####################

#' Purpose: 
#' This script cleans and standardizes edges (relationships) between theses, 
#' institutions, and persons. It utilizes data from `idref` for standardizing 
#' institution and person names and ensures removal of duplicates. It uses the
#' data cleaned in `cleaning_institutions.R` and `cleaning_persons.R`.
#' 
#' Outputs:
#' 1. A complete data frame of edges with originally scraped information for validation.
#' 2. A short, cleaned, and usable data frame of edges for analysis.

# Cleaning edges for institutions----------------------------------------------

# 1. Collect new IDs for institutions from previous cleaning steps.
#    These are updated IDs obtained from the "cleaning_institutions.R" script.

  .[, .(new_id, old_id = V1)] %>% 
  unique()

# 2. Match old IDs to entity IDs in thesis_edge and replace with new IDs.

# Cleaning Edges for Persons--------------------------------
# update person edges (merge by entity_id since we did not remove any id from script cleaning the person table, except duplicates)

# Saving the final edge tables--------------------------------
# Combine cleaned edges for institutions and persons
