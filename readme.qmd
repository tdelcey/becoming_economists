## What is the EconThesis Database project?

The goal is to create a database of the Ph.D. defended in economics in
the XXth and XXIst centuries in different countries. This project has a 
companion website, available [here](https://tdelcey.github.io/becoming_economists_page/).

This project implies:

- to collect different information through different sources (from list of PhD in `.pdf` files to online institutional databases);
- to clean these different types of information to obtain the relevant information we need: the author of the PhD dissertation, its title, its date of defence, the university, and any other useful information (PhD supervisor, classification of the PhD dissertation, like a JEL code).

At this point, the project focuses on three countries:

- France, collecting data from the [Sudoc](https://www.sudoc.abes.fr/) and [Theses.fr](https://theses.fr/?domaine=theses) databases;
- The United States, collecting data from the list of PhD granted in US universities, published each year by the *American Economic Review* and then the *Journal of Economic Literature*;
- The United Kingdom, collecting data from the [EThOS catalogue](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/collections/e492dc4b-82d9-4f8c-bb0a-2cdd8a62105d?locale=en%29).

## Organisation of the repository

The repository is organised along the different databases for each country. For each country, two folders are available:

- The "documentation" (e.g., for [France](./FR/documentation)) folders contain the documentation
  about the building of the different database. You will find detailed
  explanations about the process of collecting the data and cleaning it
  for each country.
- The "R" (e.g., for [France](./FR/R)) folders contain the different scripts used to clean and produce the database for the
  the country in question.

## Databases

You can find each database in a Zenodo repository:
